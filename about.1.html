            <h3>Starlight, Meru</h3>
            <p><a href="/index.html">Starlight foundation</a> owes it's origin to a group of <u>elegant</u> and <u>visionary</u> <i>youths</i> who came together during the COVID-19 era and try to help some of <strong>less fortunate</strong> members of the community.</p>
            <p>It's founding members include <bold>Gitonga Muthee</bold> the brain child(behind the project), <bold>Sospeter Murangiri</bold>, <bold>Wycliffe Mwiti</bold>, <bold>Joseph Muthaura</bold>, and <bold>Kelvin</bold>. Lately the foundation has recruited other member who serve in various committee.</p>
            <p><a href="/index.html">Starlight</a> has helped some families around the hood and hope to go on helping the needy. The criteria used to identify the families of much concern has been of high level carefulness. Most families range from the people with various disabilities (the needy). The <a href="/index.html">foundation</a> has grown to become popular and has its objectives growing to every day. As highlihted in our weekly meetups "trying to revive the forgotten "boy-child" factor in the society" has become a part of us.</P>
            <p>We thank all the <i>stakeholders</i> who have contributed to the <bold>tremendous</bold> growth of the foundation. "Asanti" For contribution and support please <a href="/contact.1.html">contact us</a>! #Godblesstarlight-kenya.<p>
